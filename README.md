# Written code in MATLAB that factorizes a square matrix into two triangular matrices(one lower triangular matrix L and other upper triangular matrix U) by performing both row and column interchanges whenever required. 
# Written code in MATLAB that factorizes a square matrix into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that the product of these two gives the original matrix.
